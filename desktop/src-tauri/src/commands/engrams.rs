//! Owner-gated engram (NIP-AE memory) reader for the desktop.
//!
//! IXI-7 phase 1: read-only memory surface inside the agent profile panel.
//! One Tauri call per panel open returns the entire decrypted listing —
//! `core` (if present), every non-tombstoned `mem/...` entry, and the
//! outgoing `[[slug]]` refs extracted from each body. The UI computes
//! reachability + orphans from this single payload; no incremental sync.
//!
//! Why this shape:
//! - Owner secret key never leaves Rust. The desktop signs in as the owner
//!   and decrypts via `agent ↔ owner` NIP-44 conversation key.
//! - Owner gating is enforced here: the request is accepted if the agent is
//!   in the local `managed_agents` store OR the agent's live `kind:0`
//!   cryptographically declares the viewer as its NIP-OA owner. Either way
//!   the engrams are NIP-44 encrypted to the viewer's own pubkey, so the
//!   encryption is the real boundary; this gate just decides whether to try.
//!   The UI hides the section for non-owners anyway, but defense in depth.
//! - One call returns everything because the orphans view requires the
//!   full set anyway. Lazy/per-node decrypt is deferred to IXI-60.
