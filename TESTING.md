# Testing

## Automated Tests

```bash
just test-unit          # unit tests — no infrastructure needed
just test               # unit + integration (starts Docker if needed)
```

`just test` runs unit tests plus integration tests against Postgres and Redis
(started automatically if not already running). Neither task runs the E2E suites in
`nuxx-test-client` — those are marked `#[ignore]` and require a running relay:

```bash
# Start a relay first (see below), then:
cargo test -p nuxx-test-client -- --ignored
```

---

## Live Local Relay

The fastest way to exercise the relay end-to-end is to build the release
binaries once, run `nuxx-relay`, and drive it with the `nuxx` CLI. The
CLI signs every request with NIP-98, so you don't need `nak` or hand-rolled
`curl`.

### 1. Setup

```bash
. ./bin/activate-hermit          # activate pinned toolchain
cp .env.example .env             # one-time
just setup                       # start Docker services, run migrations
```

> **Already running Nuxx Desktop?** Desktop uses the same Docker container
> names (`nuxx-postgres`, `nuxx-redis`) and the same
> default ports (`:5432`, `:6379`). `just setup` will reuse those
> services, so **your test relay writes into Desktop's database**. That's
> fine for read/write smoke tests, but: `just reset` wipes Desktop's data
> along with yours. If you need isolation, stop Desktop first or run the
> dev stack on a different Compose project
> (`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=nuxx-dev docker compose …`).

`just reset` wipes all local data and starts over — **including Nuxx
Desktop's data** if its services are sharing your dev stack (see callout
above).

> **Heads up — scrub stale env first.** If your shell inherits any of
> `NUXX_AUTH_TAG`, `NUXX_RELAY_URL`, or `NUXX_PRIVATE_KEY` from a
> prior session (or a staging config), `unset` them before continuing.
> A stale `NUXX_AUTH_TAG` fails the **local dev relay** with
> `auth_error: signature verification failed` on the first CLI write —
> it is *not* tolerated.
> ```bash
> unset NUXX_AUTH_TAG NUXX_RELAY_URL NUXX_PRIVATE_KEY
> ```

### 2. Build the binaries

```bash
cargo build --release -p nuxx-relay -p nuxx-cli -p nuxx-admin
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```

Rebuild after any code change — the steps below use the release binaries.

### 3. Start the relay

In a separate terminal (it runs in the foreground):

```bash
nuxx-relay                     # release binary from step 2, serves ws://localhost:3000
# alternatives:
# cargo run --release -p nuxx-relay     # rebuild + run in release
# just relay                            # DEBUG build — fast to launch on a hot cache,
#                                       # but mismatched if step 2 left you on release.
#                                       # Use `just relay-release` if you want the recipe.
```

Verify it's up (back in your working terminal):

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health           # → ok
curl -s http://localhost:8080/_readiness        # → {"status":"ready"}
```

> Health/readiness/liveness live on a **separate port** (default `8080`,
> `NUXX_HEALTH_PORT`) so K8s probes bypass auth middleware. The main app
> port also exposes `/health` for convenience.

The relay starts in dev mode (`NUXX_REQUIRE_AUTH_TOKEN=false`). The startup
log emits a WARN about this — that's expected for local testing. See the env
vars table at the bottom if you need to lock it down.

> **Already running Nuxx Desktop (or another relay) on `:3000` / `:8080` /
> `:9102`?** Nuxx binds three ports — main, health, metrics — and any of
> them can collide. Use a separate terminal per role and export the right
> vars in each:
>
> **In the relay terminal** (before launching `nuxx-relay`):
> ```bash
> export NUXX_BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0:3030
> export NUXX_HEALTH_PORT=8088
> export NUXX_METRICS_PORT=9202
> export RELAY_URL=ws://localhost:3030     # advertised in NIP-42 challenges
> nuxx-relay
> ```
>
> **In your working / CLI terminal** (for steps 4+ and the ACP harness):
> ```bash
> export NUXX_RELAY_URL=http://localhost:3030    # CLI target
> # verify the relay on the overridden ports:
> curl -s http://localhost:3030/health             # → ok
> curl -s http://localhost:8088/_readiness         # → {"status":"ready"}
> ```
>
> Every snippet later in this doc shows the defaults. When you see
> `localhost:3000` / `:8080` in a code block, mentally substitute your
> overrides — or the CLI will end up talking to Nuxx Desktop's relay.

> **Ignore `just setup`'s "Next steps" banner.** It still prints
> `just relay` (a debug build). Use `nuxx-relay` from step 2 here —
> step 2 already built the release binary.

When you're done, stop the relay (Ctrl-C in its terminal). If it's
backgrounded or you lost the terminal: `pkill -f nuxx-relay`. Leaving
it running will collide with the next reviewer who follows this doc on
the same machine.

### 4. Smoke test the CLI against the relay

End-to-end: generate an identity, create a channel, post a message, read it
back. This is the minimum sequence an agent needs to verify a local relay.

```bash
# Generate a keypair
GEN=$(nuxx-admin generate-key)
export NUXX_PRIVATE_KEY=$(echo "$GEN" | awk '/Secret key:/ {print $3}')
PUBKEY=$(echo "$GEN"           | awk '/Public key:/ {print $3}')
echo "pubkey: $PUBKEY"

# Create a channel — the UUID is returned in the response
CHANNEL=$(nuxx channels create --name "smoke-$$" --type stream --visibility open | jq -r '.channel_id')
echo "channel: $CHANNEL"

# Send a message and read it back
SEND=$(nuxx messages send --channel "$CHANNEL" --content "hello from smoke test")
EVENT_ID=$(echo "$SEND" | jq -r '.event_id')
nuxx messages get --channel "$CHANNEL" --limit 5 | jq .

# Fetch the reply chain for a specific message (empty array on a leaf — that's fine)
nuxx messages thread --channel "$CHANNEL" --event "$EVENT_ID" | jq .
```

A successful run prints `{"event_id":"…","accepted":true,"message":""}` for
the send, and the message body in the `get` output. `thread` returns `[]`
for a leaf message — populated only after a reply comes in (see §5).

### 5. Going deeper

For full coverage of every CLI command (54 subcommands across 12 groups),
follow [`crates/nuxx-cli/TESTING.md`](crates/nuxx-cli/TESTING.md).

The relay's HTTP bridge accepts three endpoints — useful if you're testing
a client other than `nuxx-cli`:

| Endpoint        | Purpose                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| `POST /events`  | Submit a signed Nostr event        |
| `POST /query`   | NIP-01 filter query (returns events) |
| `POST /count`   | NIP-45 count query                 |

All three accept NIP-98 auth (recommended) or, in dev mode, an `X-Pubkey`
header fallback. There is no REST API for fetching message threads — use
`POST /query` with an `#e` filter, or `nuxx messages thread`.

---

## ACP Harness (optional, end-to-end with a real agent)

`nuxx-acp` connects an ACP-speaking agent (goose, codex, claude code,
nuxx-agent) to the relay. The harness listens for events, drives the
agent over stdio, and the agent replies through MCP tools.

Minimum recipe — assumes the relay from step 3 is running and the channel
`$CHANNEL` from step 4 still exists. The agent identity must be **different**
from the sender identity (`NUXX_ACP_RESPOND_TO=anyone` still skips events
the agent signed itself).

```bash
cargo build --release -p nuxx-acp
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"

# 1. Save your sender identity from step 4 — you'll need it to @mention the agent
SENDER_SK="$NUXX_PRIVATE_KEY"

# 2. Mint a fresh agent identity and capture its pubkey
AGENT_GEN=$(nuxx-admin generate-key)
AGENT_SK=$(echo "$AGENT_GEN" | awk '/Secret key:/ {print $3}')
AGENT_PUBKEY=$(echo "$AGENT_GEN" | awk '/Public key:/ {print $3}')

# 3. Add the agent as a member of $CHANNEL — still using the sender identity.
#    Skip this and the agent boots to "discovered 0 channel(s) → agent will
#    sit idle" and silently ignores every mention.
nuxx channels add-member --channel "$CHANNEL" --pubkey "$AGENT_PUBKEY" --role member

# 4. Switch to the agent identity and start it.
#    nuxx-acp wants ws:// (not http://). If you set NUXX_RELAY_URL to an
#    http:// URL in step 3, set the ws:// equivalent here — same host/port.
export NUXX_PRIVATE_KEY="$AGENT_SK"
export NUXX_RELAY_URL=ws://localhost:3000   # match step 3 (e.g. ws://localhost:3030 if overridden)
export NUXX_ACP_RESPOND_TO=anyone           # default is owner-only; opens the gate for testing
# NIP-AE core-memory prompt injection is on by default; set NUXX_ACP_NO_MEMORY=true to opt out.
export GOOSE_MODE=auto                        # must be 'auto' or goose hangs on prompts

nuxx-acp                                    # foreground; logs to stdout (run in a separate terminal)

# Optional: turn on per-turn tracing if the default log is too quiet.
# RUST_LOG=nuxx_acp=debug nuxx-acp
```

> **Using a different ACP agent?** The default recipe assumes `goose` is on
> `$PATH` and configured (`goose --version` should print). For codex / claude
> code / nuxx-agent, set `NUXX_ACP_AGENT_COMMAND` and `NUXX_ACP_AGENT_ARGS`
> accordingly — see `crates/nuxx-acp/README.md`. Without these, nuxx-acp
> will fail to spawn the agent subprocess on startup.

If you started the agent before adding it to the channel, just run the
`add-member` afterwards — it picks up the membership notification live and
subscribes without restart (`membership notification: subscribing to new channel …`).

The justfile also ships `just goose key="$AGENT_NSEC"` (foreground) and
`just goose-bg key="$AGENT_NSEC"` (background screen session) which set the
same env. See `crates/nuxx-acp/README.md` for parallel agents, heartbeats,
respond-to gates, and forum subscriptions.

To exercise deferred ACP startup, add `NUXX_ACP_LAZY_POOL=true` before launching
`nuxx-acp`. The harness should connect, authenticate, subscribe, and publish
online presence without starting the configured ACP child. The first accepted,
flushable mention should start exactly one child and then dispatch the queued
message. Automated coverage in `pool_lifecycle_state` pins single-wake,
retry/backoff, and stale-result behavior; it does not replace this real
relay/process smoke test.

Send the agent a task — switch your shell back to the **sender** identity
from step 4 and @mention the agent:

```bash
export NUXX_PRIVATE_KEY=$SENDER_SK          # the key from step 4
nuxx messages send --channel "$CHANNEL" \
  --content "Hey agent, reply PONG only."

# Wait 10–90s, then read the channel — the agent's reply is a kind:9 from
# AGENT_PUBKEY. The current ACP build is quiet on stdout during a turn, so
# `nuxx messages get` is how you confirm it ran.
nuxx messages get --channel "$CHANNEL" --limit 5 | jq '.[] | {pubkey, content}'
```

Replies are kind:9 in the same channel; `nuxx messages thread --channel <id>
--event <event_id>` fetches the reply chain for a specific mention.

## Configuration reference

The relay reads all configuration from environment variables. Defaults work
out of the box with `just setup` or `just relay`. Common overrides:

| Variable                          | Default                     | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| `NUXX_BIND_ADDR`                | `0.0.0.0:3000`              | Main app port |
| `NUXX_HEALTH_PORT`              | `8080`                      | `/_liveness`, `/_readiness` |
| `NUXX_METRICS_PORT`             | `9102`                      | Prometheus `/metrics` |
| `RELAY_URL`                       | `ws://localhost:3000`       | Advertised in NIP-11 / NIP-42 challenges. **Note: no `NUXX_` prefix.** |
| `DATABASE_URL`                    | `postgres://nuxx:nuxx_dev@localhost:5432/nuxx` | |
| `REDIS_URL`                       | `redis://localhost:6379`    | |
| `NUXX_REQUIRE_AUTH_TOKEN`       | `false`                     | When true, REST requires NIP-98 (no `X-Pubkey` fallback) |
| `NUXX_REQUIRE_RELAY_MEMBERSHIP` | `false`                     | When true, only pubkeys in `relay_members` can connect |
| `NUXX_REQUIRE_MEDIA_GET_AUTH`   | `false`                     | When true, `GET`/`HEAD /media/*` require Blossom kind 24242 `t=get` auth plus relay membership. |
| `NUXX_AUDIT_ENABLED`            | `true`                      | Tamper-evident event/media audit log. Set `false`/`0`/`off` to skip its DB pool and writes. Does not disable the separate moderation audit trail. |
| `NUXX_AUTO_MIGRATE`             | `false`                     | Opt in with `true`/`1`/`yes`/`on` to run embedded SQLx migrations on relay startup |
| `RELAY_OWNER_PUBKEY`              | unset                       | Bootstrapped as `owner` in `relay_members` at first start |
| `NUXX_ALLOW_NIP_OA_AUTH`        | `false`                     | Enable NIP-OA owner attestation for membership |
| `NUXX_WEB_DIR`                  | unset (source), `/srv/nuxx/web` (container) | Directory containing the invite landing bundle; the production container enables it so `/invite/{code}` always works |
| `NUXX_SERVE_GIT_WEB_GUI`        | `false`                     | Set to `true` or `1` to expose the bundled Git repository browser at `/` and `/repos/...`; invite routes do not depend on this flag |

CLI-side, only two matter for testing:

| Variable                | Default                  | Notes |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| `NUXX_RELAY_URL`      | `http://localhost:3000`  | CLI relay base; accepts `ws(s)://` and normalises |
| `NUXX_PRIVATE_KEY`    | — (**required**)         | `nsec1…` or 64-char hex |
| `NUXX_AUTH_TAG`       | unset                    | Optional NIP-OA owner attestation JSON |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `relay error 500` or `400: restricted: not a channel member` after a code change | Stale binary | Rebuild and re-export `PATH`; or `cargo run` directly |
| `Address already in use` on relay start (os error 48 on macOS, 98 on Linux) | Another relay (or stale process) holding `:3000` / `:8080` / `:9102` (or your override ports) | The panic line names the failing port — read it first. Then `lsof -iTCP:3000,8080,9102 -sTCP:LISTEN` (or your override equivalents). Kill the offender (`pkill -f nuxx-relay`) or use the port-override block in step 3. If you already overrode and *still* collide, a prior reviewer left a relay running on the same alt ports — kill it or pick fresh ports |
| `auth_error: NUXX_PRIVATE_KEY is required` | Env not exported into the CLI's shell | `export NUXX_PRIVATE_KEY=...` (or pass `--private-key`) |
| `auth_error: NUXX_AUTH_TAG verification failed … signature verification failed` | A stale `NUXX_AUTH_TAG` inherited from a parent shell. The local dev relay rejects it. | `unset NUXX_AUTH_TAG` (see the scrub block in step 1) |
| `auth-required: verification failed` on a closed relay | NIP-OA attestation needed | Set `NUXX_AUTH_TAG` to the owner-issued JSON, or relax `NUXX_REQUIRE_RELAY_MEMBERSHIP` |
| `channels list` empty after `channels create` | The CLI doesn't echo the channel UUID; use the filter shown in step 4 | Or `POST /query` with `{"kinds":[39002]}` |
| ACP agent ignores all events | `NUXX_ACP_RESPOND_TO=owner-only` (default) with no owner configured | Set `NUXX_ACP_RESPOND_TO=anyone` for testing |
| ACP logs `discovered 0 channel(s)` / `no channel subscriptions resolved` | Agent identity isn't a member of any channel | `nuxx channels add-member --channel "$CHANNEL" --pubkey "$AGENT_PUBKEY" --role member` from another identity |
| `GOOSE_MODE` warning, agent hangs | Not set | `export GOOSE_MODE=auto` |
| Tests pass locally but CI fails | Forgot to run `just ci` | `just ci` runs the gate (fmt, clippy, unit tests, desktop/web builds) |
