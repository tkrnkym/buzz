//! Relay-signed moderation notice DMs (Phase 1 contract).
//!
//! Plan §0.3 (Tyler, 2026-07-07): every resolution/action notice is a real
//! nostr message in the DB, authored by the relay moderation key:
//!
//! 1. Create/reuse the two-party DM channel `{relay mod key, user}` via the
//!    participant-hash-idempotent DM model (`nuxx-db/src/dm.rs`).
//! 2. Emit kind:39000 discovery with `hidden`, `t=dm`, and `p` tags.
//! 3. Insert a relay-signed kind:9 with `h=<dm_channel_id>`.
//! 4. Publish a relay kind:0 profile named "{Community} Moderation".
//!
//! One DM thread per user per community. Non-replyable in v1 (replies are
//! v2 appeal routing). The same primitive carries reporter-resolution,
//! actioned-author, and timeout/ban notices.
//!
//! ## Privacy
//! Notices to an actioned author never name the reporter(s) or quote report
//! notes. Notices to a reporter never reveal other reporters.
//!
//! Lane ownership: L5 (Sami).
