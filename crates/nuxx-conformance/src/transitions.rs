//! Independent translation of `docs/spec/MultiTenantRelay.tla`'s `Next`
//! transition relation into Rust.
//!
//! This module is the heart of the conformance gate. It is deliberately
//! **independent** of the production reducer: it reads only the trace
//! schema in [`crate`] and the spec text in `docs/spec/MultiTenantRelay.tla`.
//! It does not import `nuxx-relay`, `nuxx-db`, `nuxx-auth`, or any other
//! production crate that could share a normalization bug with the emitter.
//!
//! ## What an "abstract state" means here
//!
//! The TLA+ spec models the relay as a multi-worker system whose state is
//! the set of accepted rows, projection rows, observations, etc. A runtime
//! trace covers ONE worker handling ONE request — so the model state we
//! carry is much smaller:
//!
//! - `resolved_community` — the server-resolved `TenantContext::community()`
//!   for this request. `Inv_NonInterference` requires every row label
//!   observed in this request be a subset of `{resolved_community}`.
//! - `bound_host` — the host label `TenantContext::host()` was bound from.
//!   `AuthCheck` / channel-less reads require `HostCommunity[host]` agree
//!   with the resolved community.
//!
//! The checker rebuilds this state independently from the FIRST trace step
//! it sees and then validates every subsequent step against it.
//!
//! ## Per-action obligations
//!
//! Each action has a triple of obligations distilled from the spec:
//!
//! 1. **State match.** `step.state_after.resolved_community` and
//!    `bound_host` agree with the checker's running model (no mid-request
//!    tenant flip).
//! 2. **Row-label confinement** (`Inv_NonInterference` line ~983,
//!    `Inv_ReadConfinement` line ~1003). Every `row_communities` entry,
//!    every accept label, must equal `resolved_community`. A single foreign
//!    label fails the trace.
//! 3. **Action-specific guards.** AuthCheck `Allow` requires host/channel
//!    agreement; channel-less reads require `HostCommunity[host] = c`;
//!    `WriteInsert` claim-vs-resolved is recorded but a mismatch is
//!    allowed at the abstract level — the spec ignores it ("host wins"),
//!    so the gate that bites mismatches is the row-label confinement on
//!    the *next* read.
