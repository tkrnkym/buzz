//! Property/fuzz-generated conformance traces.
//!
//! These tests widen the checker's exercised input space beyond the hand-
//! built fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`. The skill (skill-runtime-formal-
//! compliance) calls for "property/fuzz-generated action sequences where
//! feasible"; this is that lane.
//!
//! ## Design: invariant properties, NOT a parallel oracle
//!
//! `transitions::check_step` is small and direct. A "reference oracle" that
//! re-derived the verdict would just be a copy of the checker — testing the
//! code against itself, proving nothing. So these tests do NOT re-implement
//! the verdict. They assert **spec-derived facts** about `check_trace`'s
//! result, read off the *shape of the generated trace*:
//!
//! - any read carrying a foreign row label MUST be rejected (NonInterference)
//! - a fully clean trace MUST be accepted
//! - AuthCheck Allow + foreign claim MUST bite (IllegalTransition)
//! - ImplBug MUST bite (CoverageBreach)
//! - a mid-trace state flip MUST bite (StateMismatch)
//! - the checker never panics and is deterministic
//!
//! The only checker surface these tests touch is the public
//! [`nuxx_conformance::checker::check_trace`]. They never call
//! `transitions::check_step`, and they never depend on a production crate.
//!
//! ## Fail-fast discipline
//!
//! `check_trace` returns the FIRST error it finds. So every property that
//! asserts a *specific* error variant must construct traces in which the
//! targeted violation is the first/only one — otherwise an earlier
//! `StateMismatch` / `IllegalTransition` / `CoverageBreach` would mask the
//! variant under test. Each generator below is built to honor that.
