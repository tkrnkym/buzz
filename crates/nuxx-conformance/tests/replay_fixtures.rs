//! Replay-fixture integration test.
//!
//! These fixtures are the load-bearing evidence that the runtime
//! conformance gate is **not decorative**. Each fixture is one
//! end-to-end JSONL trace, replayed through [`check_trace`], with the
//! expected verdict baked into the assertion.
//!
//! Eva's review (thread `06aaf3f7…`) green-lit cutting these as the
//! visible proof the gate bites. Coverage:
//!
//! - `good.jsonl` — a positive trace shaped like a real ingest:
//!   AuthCheck Allow → WriteInsert → ReadMessageRows with rows confined
//!   to the resolved community. `check_trace` returns `Ok(())`.
//! - `bad_host_channel_mismatch.jsonl` — a host/channel fence skip:
//!   the bound host is for community A, the write targets a channel in
//!   community B. The checker fails with `IllegalTransition`.
//! - `bad_coverage_breach.jsonl` — a trace that contains an `ImplBug`
//!   action (what `EmitGuard::Drop` emits when a critical seam exits
//!   without recording anything). The checker fails with
//!   `CoverageBreach`.
//!
//! The JSONL files are committed as "golden" artifacts under
//! `tests/fixtures/` for reviewer visibility, but this test also
//! round-trips: it constructs the trace in Rust, serializes it to a
//! temp file, reads it back, and asserts both the serialized form
//! matches the committed file AND the parsed form gives the expected
//! verdict. That way a schema change cannot silently desync the
//! committed JSONL from what the relay actually emits.
