# Harbor Nuxx Orchestra

A stock-Harbor custom agent that runs a manifest-defined team through the real
Nuxx stack. Harbor sees one `NuxxOrchestraAgent`; behind that adapter, one
orchestrator and N workers coordinate over the production relay/Postgres.
Each agent runs *inside* the Harbor task container as the same
`nuxx-acp` → `nuxx-agent` → `nuxx-dev-mcp` process tree the harness
launches: the production MCP toolset (shell, file tools, todo) with the
`nuxx` CLI on the shell's PATH. No Harbor fork or patch is required.

## Define the team

The manifest is the benchmark condition. Each roster entry selects an agent
class's count, model endpoint, byte-pinned system prompt, generation settings,
and budget:

```yaml
condition: my-team
roster:
  - id: orch
    kind: orchestrator
    role: lead
    count: 1
    endpoint: databricks/frontier
    prompt: {path: personas/orchestrator.md, sha256: <sha256>}
    generation: {max_output_tokens: 4096, context_window_tokens: 128000}
  - id: worker
    kind: worker
    role: implementer
    count: 4
    endpoint: databricks/fast-worker
    prompt: {path: personas/worker.md, sha256: <sha256>}
    generation: {max_output_tokens: 4096, context_window_tokens: 128000}
```

`endpoint_config` maps those endpoint names to providers, URLs, and API-key
environment variables. The adapter contains no fixed roster or model.

## Run

With the production compose stack and model endpoints already running, execute
one task (`-p`), a directory of tasks, or replace `-p` with Harbor's dataset and
task selectors:

```bash
uv run --project benchmarks/harbor-nuxx-orchestra/testbed harbor run --yes -p <TASK_OR_DIRECTORY> --agent harbor_nuxx_orchestra:NuxxOrchestraAgent --agent-kwarg manifest=<CONDITION.yaml> --agent-kwarg provisioner_factory=harbor_nuxx_testbed:provisioner_from_dict --agent-kwarg provisioner_config=<PROVISIONER.json> --agent-kwarg endpoint_config=<ENDPOINTS.json> --agent-kwarg artifact_root=benchmarks/harbor-nuxx-orchestra --agent-kwarg nuxx_acp_binary=<LINUX_BIN>/nuxx-acp --agent-kwarg nuxx_agent_binary=<LINUX_BIN>/nuxx-agent --agent-kwarg nuxx_dev_mcp_binary=<LINUX_BIN>/nuxx-dev-mcp --agent-kwarg nuxx_cli_binary=target/debug/nuxx --agent-kwarg run_id="bench-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)" --agent-timeout-multiplier 15 --n-concurrent 1
```

`nuxx_acp_binary`/`nuxx_agent_binary`/`nuxx_dev_mcp_binary` must be **Linux**
builds matching the task image architecture — they are uploaded into each task
container (`just benchmark` cross-builds them automatically; musl-static, so
any Linux base image works). `nuxx_cli_binary` is the **host** CLI the harness
uses to act as the trial user.

`--n-concurrent 1` is the safe laptop setting for a serialized local model; it
is not an orchestration requirement. Some TB graders install dependencies from
public package registries at verification time — run benchmarks off networks
that block those installs (e.g. corporate VPNs).

Each trial gets fresh keys and a private Nuxx channel. The provisioner archives
rather than deletes that channel, leaving the relay/Postgres event timeline
and the per-agent acp/agent logs (downloaded into the trial's `nuxx/`
artifacts) available for analysis.

## Leaderboard runs

`just benchmark` is the one-command path: it stands up a dedicated Docker
stack (`nuxx-benchmark` compose project — relay :3600, Postgres :5633, secrets
generated once into the gitignored `.benchmark/`), applies the benchmark
schema, and defaults to leaderboard-eligible settings (Terminal-Bench 2.1,
5 attempts per problem, the Sonnet+Haiku team). All selectors pass through:

```bash
just benchmark                                   # full TB 2.1, k=5
just benchmark --path <TASK_DIR> -k 1            # one local task, one attempt
just benchmark -i "cobol*" --attempts 3          # dataset subset
```

One pinned user identity fronts the whole benchmark environment: it owns
every trial channel (named after the task) and posts every task prompt, and
trial channels are kept rather than archived. The run prints that user's nsec,
so you can sign into the web client as them and watch channels fill as the run
progresses — watch, don't type; a human message mid-trial would taint the run.
`just benchmark-down` stops the stack.

Networking: the relay is host-header tenant-bound, so agents must dial its
canonical address (`ws://localhost:3600`) even from inside a task container.
`just benchmark` uploads a tiny std-only loopback forwarder
([`forwarder/relay_forwarder.rs`](forwarder/relay_forwarder.rs)) with the
agent stack; it listens on the container's loopback and bridges the byte
stream to the Docker host gateway (`host.docker.internal`, overridable via
`NUXX_BENCHMARK_DOCKER_HOST`).

`scripts/run_leaderboard.py` is the layer underneath, for running against an
already-provisioned stack. It wraps the invocation above with only
leaderboard-legal settings — it does not accept or forward timeout or resource
overrides, so the job directory it produces passes Harbor's static validation
as-is. Give it a problem set, attempts per problem, and a team manifest:

```bash
uv run --project benchmarks/harbor-nuxx-orchestra/testbed \
    benchmarks/harbor-nuxx-orchestra/scripts/run_leaderboard.py \
    --dataset terminal-bench/terminal-bench-2-1 \
    --attempts 5 \
    --manifest benchmarks/harbor-nuxx-orchestra/manifests/<TEAM>.yaml \
    --endpoint-config benchmarks/harbor-nuxx-orchestra/testbed/endpoints/<ENDPOINTS>.json \
    --provisioner-config <PROVISIONER.json>
```

`--path` replaces `--dataset` for local task directories; `--include-task` /
`--exclude-task` filter by glob; `--dry-run` prints the underlying `harbor run`
command. After the job finishes the script derives a `metadata.yaml` from the
manifest roster (validated schema; review the display names before submitting)
and prints the `harbor upload` / `harbor leaderboard submit` commands.

## Validate

```bash
cd benchmarks/harbor-nuxx-orchestra
uv run --extra dev pytest -q
uv run --extra dev ruff check .
cd testbed
uv run --extra dev pytest -q
uv run --extra dev ruff check .
```

Live provisioner tests require the benchmark compose stack and opt-in
environment described in `testbed/tests/test_provisioner_live.py`.
