//! Loopback TCP forwarder for the benchmark task container.
//!
//! The benchmark relay is host-header tenant-bound: its community row is the
//! authority of its own `RELAY_URL` (e.g. `localhost:3600`), and a request
//! presenting any other `Host` fails closed. Agents inside a Harbor task
//! container can only reach the host-published relay via the Docker host
//! alias (`host.docker.internal`), which would present the wrong `Host`.
//!
//! So the container runtime uploads this forwarder next to the agent stack:
//! agents dial `ws://localhost:<port>` — presenting the exact `Host` the
//! community row expects — and the forwarder bridges the byte stream to the
//! host gateway. Transparent to everything above TCP (WebSocket, the nuxx
//! CLI, git-over-HTTP). std-only; compiled with plain `rustc` against the
//! musl target, so it runs on any Linux task image.
//!
//! Usage: `relay-forwarder <listen-addr> <target-addr>`
